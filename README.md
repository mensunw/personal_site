### Hi there o/ I'm Mensun Wang

I'm a senior at Boston University pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science, graduating in **May 2025**. I've been passionate about coding since 7th grade â€” from building small games in high school to contributing to full-stack and AI-driven projects in college.

I'm currently looking for **new grad or internship opportunities** â€” any leads or advice are truly appreciated!

I'll admit, I'm not the best at showcasing myself with words, so I hope my repositories and contributions speak for themselves. Thanks for stopping by!
